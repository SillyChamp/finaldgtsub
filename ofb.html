               <p>
                   Since late 2018 and the release of Bad B on the Nizz, when they covered their faces in their videos like many young drill artists do to avoid being recognised by members of their communities and families, to thwart surveillance from police teams and stop prosecutors using videos as evidence in court, OFB have soared to hood stardom. Like all drill collectives starting out, they garnered most of their popularity via crisply filmed music videos on YouTube, including Purge and Reality. Their first mixtape, Front Street, is out at Halloween. The group’s steep upward trajectory shows how drill has become a source of empowerment and income for poor, black British teenage boys facing a vacuum of prospective career opportunities, unaddressed trauma from impoverished home lives and combat on the roads, and the daily ritual of disproportionate police attention.

                    OFB’s most acclaimed anthem is called Ambush, in which the three members go back-to-back in shortened bursts of bars, as if fighting for space over a pirate radio set. It has enabled them to stand out from the fiercely competitive, citywide ecosystem of drillers. “Now, after that song, I’m seeing everyone else come on that back-to-back ting,” Bandokay says. “But it’s calm because I understand that’s the game – everyone learns off each other.”

                    In May, the song’s video, filmed among the warren of walkways and car parks of Broadwater Farm, was removed from YouTube. It had been watched more than 2m times. This sort of obstacle became commonplace for drill artists, as the Metropolitan police pursued a vague crackdown on videos they deem to be inciting violence (this summer, YouTube announced it would no longer be deleting drill videos, but would continue to work with police to “take action when needed”).
