                   Irving Adjei, known professionally as Headie One, is an English rapper from Tottenham, North London. He is best known for his track "18HUNNA" which peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number 6. Adjei grew up on the "infamous" Broadwater Farm housing estate in Tottenham. He is of Ghanaian origin. His moniker derives from a childhood nickname due to his head's resemblance to a 50p coin. He first began rapping in his early teens, though only began focusing on it after his first release from prison.

                    He began releasing music in the early 2010s under the name Headz, including as part of a group named Star Gang. In 2014 he released his only mixtape under that alias, titled "Headz or Tails." Also part of Star Gang was fellow Tottenham rapper RV - he and Headie One became frequent collaborators, including co-releasing the mixtapes Sticks and Stones (2016) and Drillers x Trappers (2017). Together they formed part of OFB, a drill crew based in the Broadwater Farm estate.
